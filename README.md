## 3DTerminal 

Wouldn't you just kill for a 3D model renderer in your terminal environment? No? Well here's one anyway.
3DTerminal is a basic 3D model renderer supporting ASCII OBJ, STL (in progress), and COLLADA (in progress) file formats.

I'm mostly just developing this for the aesthetic value - check out that teapot.
